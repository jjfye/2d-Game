# Programming
This module required me to create a fully functional game using Processing3 which is coded using Java. The user must be able to control a character to collect coins that would spawn randomly on the screen whilst having to avoid enemies who could damage the user. This game includes using multiple classes, constructors, methods, inheritance, functions and enums.
